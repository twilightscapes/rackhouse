A Rack House, by definition, is a warehouse which distillers use to store and age their hundreds and thousands of barrels of these wonderful libations.

We have also started the first Bourbon Society on the Gulf Coast which brings its members together to share their love of the various bourbons, ryes, whiskeys and scotches which don our shelves.

We have decorated the restaurant to capture the look and feel of a Rack House and hope you enjoy the terrific ambiance it creates.
